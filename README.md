Let's learn Promises.

Promises in JavaScript provide a way to handle asynchronous operations. 
They allow you to write code that will only execute after a specific task (like fetching data from a server) has completed. 
Here's a step-by-step overview of how promises work and how you can use them:

Creating a Promise<br>
A promise is created using the Promise constructor, which takes a function with two parameters: resolve and reject.

Consuming a Promise<br>
To handle the result of a promise, you use the .then() method for successful completion and the .catch() method for handling errors.
Chaining Promises

Promise Chaining<br>
Promises can be chained together to handle a series of asynchronous operations.<br>
Chaining promises in JavaScript allows you to execute multiple asynchronous operations in sequence.
